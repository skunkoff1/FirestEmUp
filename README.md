# FirstEmUp

First shootemup project ever, made with javascript canvas

HOW TO PLAY :

- Z, Q, S, D or Directional arrows to move,
- P to pause / unpause game.
- K to shoot
- L to get a small speed boost

. When you are shooting, you move slower
. If you collide with an ennemy, you'll die
. Keep killing ennemies without getting hit to increase your score multiplier !

The game records highscores on a database to display them. May the best player win !
